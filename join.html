<h1>Join Acing The Internet!</h1>
<p><strong>Applications to join are currently closed so I can catch up on reviewing existing applications! Any requests to join during the time that applications are closed will be refused. In a week or two, they'll open back up, so please wait until then. The form is being left up so that existing webring members may edit their information.</strong></p>
<h2>Criteria to join</h2>
<ul>
<li>You must be asexual (identities under the asexual spectrum count).
<li>You must have a personal site where you can put the webring widget, does not have to be hosted on Neocities.
<li>If your site contains any NSFW content, it must be clearly marked as 18+.
<li>Your site must not have any hate speech or bigotry.
<li>Bigotry here includes generalized/blanket statements or rants about marginalized identities, even those you may belong to yourself, that would make someone of that identity potentially uncomfortable to see. See the note below for more on this.
<li>Your site cannot be advertisement-focused (having a page/section with your social media links is fine and mentioning that you're, for example, an artist who takes commissions is fine, but the sole purpose of the website should not be advertisement).
<li>You must add the webring widget somewhere on either a homepage or a webrings page. If I notice the webring widget is removed, I may remove you from the webring and send you an email to notify you of the issue.
<li>I strongly encourage visiting your fellow webring members' pages, leaving comments, and interacting with each other!
</ul>

<p><small>It is impossible to enumerate everything that is not allowed. For this reason, I (the webmaster) reserve the right to remove a site if I feel it is outside of my own personal bounds.</small></p>

<p>If you have any issues joining or need to contact me for any reason, please feel free to <a href="mailto:punkwasp@protonmail.com">send me an email</a>.</p>

<h2>Add yourself to the members list</h2>
<p>Add a unique slug, your webpage's name, and your webpage's URL to <a href={{site.github_repo_url}}/blob/main/_data/members.csv>the members list on GitHub</a> in a pull request.<br>
Pull requests can also be used to change your existing entry or delete your entry.</p>

<h2>Add links on your webpage</h2>
<p>Once you're on the members list, add the webring widget on your page with this code (replace YOURSLUG with your slug, and preferably upload the button image to your own website rather than hotlinking):<br>
<textarea>&lt;a href="https://acingtheinternet.netlify.app/YOURSLUG/previous"&gt;back&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://acingtheinternet.netlify.app"&gt;&lt;img src="https://punkwasp.neocities.org/images/buttons/asexuals_now.gif" alt="A button saying asexuals now"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://acingtheinternet.netlify.app/YOURSLUG/next"&gt;next&lt;/a&gt;</textarea><br>
